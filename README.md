# React Native Honeywell Scanner

This package is a merge of ideas between https://github.com/AMI3GOLtd/react-native-honeywell-scanner and https://github.com/id-group/esb24-honeywell-scanner. It works on React > 0.70 and deprecates the broken `.on()` functions from the older packages as it will not work in newer solutions.

I am still planning to clean up this package and write a proper `@types` entry for it later so it can work out of the box. If you want to use this one you'll have to create ony yourself if you are using typescript.
